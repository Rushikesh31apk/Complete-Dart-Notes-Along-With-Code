## Introduction to Dart

Dart is a client-optimized programming language developed by Google. It is used to build mobile, web, and server applications. Dart is especially popular for developing mobile apps with Flutter. In this section, you'll find the basic setup and introduction to Dart programming concepts.

## Basic Dart Syntax

This section covers the basic syntax of Dart, including:
- Variables and constants
- Data types
- Operators
- Basic input/output

## Control Flow

Learn how to manage the flow of your Dart programs using:
- If/else statements
- Switch statements
- Loops (for, while, do-while)

## Functions

This section explains how to create functions in Dart:
- Function declarations
- Named parameters
- Anonymous functions
- Arrow functions

## Classes and Objects

In Dart, classes and objects are central to the object-oriented programming model. In this section, we cover:
- Class creation
- Constructors
- Instance variables and methods
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Collections

Learn how to use Dart's built-in collection types, such as:
- Lists
- Sets
- Maps
- Iterables

## Error Handling

In this section, we explore how to handle errors in Dart using:
- Try-catch blocks
- Throwing exceptions
- Custom error classes

## Asynchronous Programming

Asynchronous programming is essential for building non-blocking applications. Learn about:
- Futures and async/await
- Streams
- StreamController

## Dart Packages and Libraries

This section explains how to work with Dart's powerful libraries and packages:
- Importing standard libraries like `dart:io`, `dart:math`, etc.
- Creating and using custom libraries
- Using external packages from `pub.dev`

## File Handling

Learn how to perform file operations in Dart using `dart:io`, including:
- Reading and writing files
- Handling directories
- Using streams for file handling

## Additional Resources
